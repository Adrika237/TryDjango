# TryDjango
Trial Django Project
This is a sample Django project created from scratch. Code is visible in "master" branch.

I have created 2 apps - pages and products inside the project.
For the purpose of this interview, i would like to showcase my code in the "Products" app.
You will be able to find models, forms ,views and templates within this app.
